## Basic led matrix clock on Arduino platform

A very basic clock with extra information on a time based manner. It display hour, date, temperature and humidity.

Using a Max7219 led panel, DHT11 sensor for temp and humidity and the DS1302 module for offering real time clock.

The information will be display one after the other with a delay in between: time, date, temp, humidity and starts all over again. 

It also has a wip programming mode to be able to set up the rtc module without compiling the code.



## Libraries

This project uses DHT, SPI, Adafruit_GFX, Max72xxPanel and virtualbotixRTC libraries.

## Case

I printed this [awesome 3D Case by CrazyIndiana](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4886633). The final touches are work in progress ;)
